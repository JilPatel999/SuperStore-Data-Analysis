# US Superstore Sales Analysis  

**Short Description:**  
Retail sales analysis of the Superstore dataset using Python (EDA in Jupyter Notebook) and Tableau (dashboard). Highlights KPIs, sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability insights for portfolio presentation.  

---

## üìå Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Superstore dataset** (Excel file: `Superstore(1).xlsx`), a popular sample dataset for retail and sales analysis. The goal is to explore trends in sales, profit, and customer behavior using both **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for in-depth analysis and **Tableau** for interactive dashboard visualizations.  

By combining data analysis with visualization, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can highlight key performance indicators (KPIs), identify profitable/unprofitable product categories, and track year-over-year growth.
